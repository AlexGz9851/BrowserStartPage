# BrowserStartPage
A browser start page for "Web Laboratory" lecture.

## Extension

### How to load the extension

- Inside the `extension` folder run `npm run build`
- In chrome open `chrome://extensions`
- And click on the `Load unpacked` button, and select the `BrowserStartPage/extension/build` folder.

If no change is done to the manifest then you can just run `npm run build` to update the changes of the extension and no need to update the extension inside `chrome://extensions`
